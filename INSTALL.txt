SerialUI Installation

If you're using the Arduino IDE and building for 
Arduino, the installation procedure is the same
as for any library and is described fully at:

http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

The short version is: plop the SerialUI directory
(folder) found within the zip file into your 
Arduino libraries directory. 

The libraries directory location is system-dependent,
but will be something like:

	~/sketchbook/libraries (Linux),
	Documents/Arduino/libraries/ (mac),
or
	My Documents\Arduino\libraries\ (windows)


Apparently, with newer version of the Arduino IDE,
you can import libraries from the IDE itself.  I've
yet to try this version--see the link above for 
details and let me know if it works.

You'll need to restart the Arduino IDE before you
see SerialUI in the
	File -> Examples
and
	Sketch -> Import Library
listings.

Do have a look at the 

	File -> Examples -> SerialUI -> SuperBlinker

example, the README.txt and/or the SerialUI.h header
file.

For other platforms/dev environments, just include 
the contents of the SerialUI directory wherever 
appropriate ;-)
